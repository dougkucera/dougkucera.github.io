 	<h2>Java</h2>
	 	<ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>QUESTION:<br>When would you use &quot;=&quot; vs &quot;==&quot; vs &quot;.equals&quot;? Explain what each of these does and in  which cases you should use them. </p>
	      <p> ANSWER:<br>Each 'symbol' would seem like the same way to accomplish the same thing but each is unique and used for a different purpose.</p>
	      <ul>
	      	<li>&quot;=&quot; is called an assignment operator and used to assign a value to a variable.  An example would be int x = 10; .</li>
	      	<li>&quot;==&quot; is a comparison operator to compare values OTHER THAN strings.  A good example would be if used in an if statement:  &quot;if x == y&quot;
	    		</li>
	      	<li>Similar to&quot;==&quot;,  &quot;.equals&quot; is the comparison operator used to compare strings.   A similar example would be if used in an if statement:  &quot;if string1 == string2&quot;</li>
	    	</ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>QUESTION:<br>What does it mean to &quot;cast a double to an int&quot;? Give an example of when you would do  this and explain what is happening.</p>
	    </li>
	    <p>ANSWER:<br>Type casting is used to assign a variable type to a different type.  This may be used if the original assigned variable type is not compatable in a way that you need it to be.  An example would be if the original variable definition were of type double, but you needed it to be an integer (int):</p>
	    <ul>
	    	<li> double d = 2.0;</li>
	    	<li>int = x, sum;</li>
	    	<li> If you needed to sum d and x, you would need to make the variables of the same type:</li>
	    	<li>sum = x + (int)d;</li>
	    </ul>
	    <li>
	      <p>QUESTION:<br>What happens when you include &quot;import java.util.Scanner;&quot; in your code? Where does  this functionality come from? What is the &quot;java&quot; in &quot;java.util.Scanner;&quot;?</p>
	      <p>ANSWER:<br>Including the &quot;import&quot; statement will include the Javd uitility library.  In this case &quot; import java.util.Scanner &quot;, will include the functionality that controls the reading and capturing of user input.  Libraries are sets of pre-written code that can reduce the amount of code written to perform common functionality.  
	    </li>
	    <li>
	     <p>QUESTION:<br>What is the difference between &quot;switch&quot; and &quot;if/else&quot;? When would you use one versus  the other?</p>
	     <p>ANSWER:<br>The major difference between &quot;switch&quot; and &quot;if/else&quot; is how the expression is checked.  
	     <ul>
	     	<li>If/else:  Walks sequentially through the condition starting with the first &quot;if&quot;.  It will work through the if/else until it finds a matching condition or reaches the end of the statement.</li>
	     	<li>Switch: has indexed the values to be matched and will jump to the matching value or move to the last &quot;default&quot; case and execute/exit.</li>
	     	</ul>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <p>QUESTION:<br>What is &quot;void&quot; in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method  with a return type? </p>
	    </li>
	    <p>ANSWER:<br>Void in a method declaration denotes that nothing will be returned from that method.  An example would be: &quot;public void funtionName()&quot;</p>
	    <p>If a return value is expected, the type would be declared as so:  &quot;public static int functionName()&quot;</p>
	  </ul>
